# Shopify Merchant Revenue & Retention Analytics

This repository contains an analytics case study simulating how Shopify could
use data to improve merchant retention, increase GMV, and identify high-value
merchant segments.

The analysis is based on public and synthetic e-commerce data and focuses on:
- Revenue and GMV performance
- Merchant segmentation and engagement
- Retention and churn analysis
- Executive-level dashboarding

This project is not an official Shopify dashboard.
